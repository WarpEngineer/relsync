# TODO

1. Clean up error messages. I need to look at the source code to figure
   out what went wrong most of the time, so I feel for other users. For
   examples, put a compile error in the relsync_hooks.erl file or try
   to update a target that is off or try to update an executable that
   is being run.

2. Handle updating multiple boards at once. Some code is there, but
   the command line doesn't support it.

3. Add more docs.
